        <h2 id="hiImDerek">Hi, I'm Derek from Sundust Photography!</h2>
        <h3>I’m a photographer based in Summerville, SC, who is passionate about capturing candid and honest moments in everyday life. My goal is to blend the beauty of human nature with an artistic touch, creating images that feel authentic and meaningful.</h3>

    <h3>My journey into photography began when I was very young and opened my first <i>National Geographic</i> magazine. The stunning imagery inside sparked a desire to capture life as those professionals did, and that passion has stayed with me ever since.</h3>

    <h3>As a novice photographer, I’m working to build my portfolio and develop my style. While I may not have a signature aesthetic yet, I love experimenting with perspective and composition to create unique and creative shots that stand out.</h3>

    <h3>When I’m not behind the camera, I’m a proud dad raising my two beautiful daughters. You’ll often find me working on other creative projects, from sketching and drawing to editing photos. I’m also pursuing a Graphic Design degree and constantly working to enhance my skills.</h3>

    <h3>I’m inspired by a quote from a photographer I admire, James Popsys:</h3>
        <h3 id="quote">“Take photos that are about things rather than of things.”</h3>
    <h3>This philosophy has fueled my passion and reminds me to focus on the stories and emotions behind every shot. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me, and I can’t wait to work with you to capture something truly special.</h3>

    <h3>Let’s connect! Feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear your story and help bring your vision to life.</h3>
