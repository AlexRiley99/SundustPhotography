    <div id="aboutDiv">
      <p id="hiImDerek">Hi, I'm Derek from Sundust Photography!</p>
      <p>
        I’m a photographer based in Summerville, SC, who is passionate about
        capturing candid and honest moments in everyday life. My goal is to
        blend the beauty of human nature with an artistic touch, creating images
        that feel authentic and meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey into photography began when I was very young and opened my
        first <i>National Geographic</i> magazine. The stunning imagery inside
        sparked a desire to capture life as those professionals did, and that
        passion has stayed with me ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a novice photographer, I’m working to build my portfolio and develop
        my style. While I may not have a signature aesthetic yet, I love
        experimenting with perspective and composition to create unique and
        creative shots that stand out.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not behind the camera, I’m a proud dad raising my two beautiful
        daughters. You’ll often find me working on other creative projects, from
        sketching and drawing to editing photos. I’m also pursuing a Graphic
        Design degree and constantly working to enhance my skills.
      </p>

      <p>I’m inspired by a quote from a photographer I admire, James popsys:</p>
      <p id="quote">
        “Take photos that are about things rather than of things.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This philosophy has fueled my passion and reminds me to focus on the
        stories and emotions behind every shot. I’m excited to see where this
        journey takes me, and I can’t wait to work with you to capture something
        truly special.
      </p>
